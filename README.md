Customer Purchase Prediction using Decision Tree Classifier

This project aims to build a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. The classifier is trained on a dataset obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, specifically the Bank Marketing dataset.

Workflow:

Data Preparation: The dataset is prepared by cleaning and preprocessing it to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features if necessary.

Feature Selection: Relevant features that are likely to influence the purchase decision are selected from the dataset.

Model Training: A decision tree classifier is trained on the preprocessed dataset. During training, the decision tree learns patterns and relationships between the input features (demographic and behavioral data) and the target variable (customer purchase behavior).

Model Evaluation: The trained decision tree classifier is evaluated using a separate testing dataset to assess its predictive performance. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are calculated to measure the model's effectiveness in predicting customer purchase behavior.

Prediction: Once the decision tree classifier is trained and evaluated, it can be used to make predictions on new, unseen data. The model takes the demographic and behavioral data of a customer as input and predicts whether they are likely to purchase a product or service.

Conclusion: By leveraging a decision tree classifier, businesses can gain insights into customer purchase behavior and optimize their marketing strategies accordingly. This predictive model helps businesses target their marketing efforts more effectively, leading to increased sales and customer satisfaction.
